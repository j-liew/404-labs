http://www.google.com/ must be visited to get the 200 status code

which is the same code returned by curl -i http://google.com/teapot

curl http://www.google.com/teapot

(as does curl -iL http://google.com/teapot after redirecting)

curl -i https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~hindle1/1.py

<P>No form fields.
<DL>
</DL>

curl -i -X POST -d "X=Y" https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~hindle1/1.py

OUTPUT:
<H3>Form Contents:</H3>
<DL>
<DT>X: <i>&lt;type 'instance'&gt;</i>
<DD>MiniFieldStorage('X', 'Y')
</DL>

The output of the second command stores and displays the values of the parameters sent to it via the POST request.  

The POST method is useful for sending data to a server

For example, lets say that a website has a form that asks a user for their email.  When the user types in their email and submits the form, they
are likely sending a POST request to the server with a parameter "email" set to whatever they inputted.  The server can then store or do whatever with the email.
