1.
specifying a socket in python:
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
or with socket.socket... as s

AF_INET speficies ipv4
SOCK_STREAM specifies TCP

2.
client and server socket differences:
a server socket must first bind() to a host and port, then listen() on that host and port for connections and then accept() incoming connections

a client socket connects to a specified host and port (of a server socket that is assumed to be listening for connections)

3.
s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)

we turn on the socket option SO_REUSEADDR, which specifies "that the rules used in validating addresses supplied
in a bind(2) call should allow reuse of local addresses" (from documentation)

4. 
we get the host/IP address of the connecting client, and the port number that it is using to connect

5. it returns an empty binary string: b''
